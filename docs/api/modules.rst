IGP2 API
========

IGP2 exposes a large API that allows you to access all of its features and to add your own behaviour and code.

This page describes most of the API, though some minor classes and functions may be missing.
The page is organised according to signatures sorted alphabetically in increasing order.

**Note: This documentation is up to date to the latest stable release on the main branch.**
If you are using the ``dev`` branch, then the content here may be out of date.

The top-level module of IGP2 also imports all other submodules and their classes, such that most of the functionality of IGP2 can be access by typing ``igp2.*``, where ``*`` is the name of function, class, or module.
